Labs to demonstrate Network Security.

- ArpSpoofing / Poisoning
- MITM

It was inspired by the great labs from : https://github.com/docker/labs 

Uses tools like
- Docker
- Mininet ???
  - Still to be investiguated https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Mininet-VM-Images
- VirtualBox
- dsniff, MITMProxy, 


Other tools:
- Looks like NetKit used to have many labs and teaching material. But they seems to be abandonned? Also the http://www.Kathara.org/ looked promising, but did not work (for me).
